function [atm_pres_interface,atm_pres_level] = ECMWF_pres_sfc2atm_L137(sfc_pres)
% convert surface pressure to atmospheric pressure w/ 137 level, 138 interface
%
% Input:
%       sfc_pres, [lat,lon] (Pa)
% 
% Output:
%       atm_pres_interface, [lat,lon,138-level(top-down)] (Pa)
%       atm_pres_level, [lat,lon,137-layer(top-down)] (Pa)
% 
% Note:
%       Per ECMWF, level is between interface, https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds627.0/docs/Eta_coordinate/
% 
%       In CRTM, there is layer=level of ECMWF, level=interface
%       MiRS use this code and average level pressure for layer pressure
